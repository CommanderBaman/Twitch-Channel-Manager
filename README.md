# Twitch Channel Manager
Your one stop manager for handling channel on twitch. Sort and group channels according to your needs.

My followed channels list got too large and I wanted a way to group them. I am working on this extension as a hobby. Please tell me if there's already some tool that works this out. 


# Deployment
Not deployed anywhere. Just for personal use. Will move to [Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) once I am happy with what I have.
